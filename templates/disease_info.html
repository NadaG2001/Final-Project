                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
                    <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A newly inverted nipple
                    </li>
                    <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple
                        (areola) or breast skin</li>
                    <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Causes</h3>
                <p>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells
                    divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells
                    may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br>
                    Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma).
                    Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or
                    in other cells or tissue within the breast.
                    <br>
                    Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your
                    risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer,
                    yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex
                    interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.

                <h3>1) Perimeter Worst</h3>
                <p>The perimeter of a breast cancer lesion can be an indicator of the extent of the cancer's spread. In
                    general, a well-defined, smooth perimeter can indicate a localized, early-stage cancer, while a
                    poorly defined or irregular perimeter may suggest that the cancer has spread and is in a more
                    advanced stage.

                <h3>2) Area Worst</h3>
                <p> the area of a breast cancer lesion can also be a factor in determining the stage and prognosis of
                    the disease. A larger area of involvement may indicate a more advanced stage of cancer, as it
                    suggests that the tumor has grown and spread.

                <h3>3) Radius Worst</h3>
                <p>The radius of a breast cancer lesion refers to the size of the tumor and can be an important factor
                    in determining the stage and prognosis of the disease. A larger tumor size may indicate a more
                    advanced stage of cancer, as it suggests that the tumor has had more time to grow and spread
                </p>

                <h3>4) Concave Points Worst</h3>
                <p>Concave points, or indentations, on the surface of a breast lesion can sometimes be seen on imaging
                    studies and can be an indicator of the extent and type of a breast cancer. The presence of concave
                    points can suggest that the cancer has invaded surrounding tissue, which can indicate a more
                    advanced stage of disease.
